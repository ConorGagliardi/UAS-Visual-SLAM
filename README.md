# UAS-Visual-SLAM
Using Flightmare to simulate ORB SLAM on a UAS using ROS in a catkin workspace

See the catkin_ws for implementations.

Mainly created files within catkin_ws>src>flightmare>flightros (src/slam folder all created, and cmakelists / launch files modified to faciliate new code)
Edited various launch files in orb_slam, to work with onboard camera in simulation.
